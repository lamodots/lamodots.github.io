### What I learned

This little project has help me explore more on sass. little did i know before that one singl error in your scss file will stop the scss from compling. 

I learned more on typography using type scalle.

 see code snippets, see below:

```html
<h2>Get <span>insights</span> that help your business grow. </h2>
```
```css
.wrapper{
       
        width: 320px;
        height: 585px;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        border-radius: 8px; 
        
    } /*Displays the content of the wrapper in collumns in mobile*/
```
```js
No js script used
```



### Continued development

I do like to focus on implimemting flex and grid systems. I have made it a rule to always
made sure i use divs as container when planning out my html. This could help me move things around.




### Useful resources
